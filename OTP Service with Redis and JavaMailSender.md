# OTP Service with Redis and JavaMailSender

This project implements an OTP (One-Time Password) generation and verification system using **Spring Boot**, **Redis**, and **JavaMailSender**. It is designed to store OTPs temporarily with automatic expiration and send OTPs via email for user verification.

---

## üì¶ **Maven Dependencies for OTP Service**

```xml
<!-- Spring Boot Starter Data Redis (for RedisTemplate) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- Spring Boot Starter Mail (for JavaMailSender to send OTP emails) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-mail</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **What These Dependencies Do:**
- **`spring-boot-starter-data-redis`**: Provides everything you need to interact with Redis using `RedisTemplate`.
- **`spring-boot-starter-mail`**: Gives you `JavaMailSender` to send OTP emails via SMTP.

---

## üìÅ **Configuration for Redis and Mail in `application.properties`**

```properties
# Redis configuration
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379

# Mail configuration
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your_email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your_email_password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
```

### **Summary:**
These two dependencies will allow you to:
- Send OTP emails via `JavaMailSender`.
- Store OTPs in Redis temporarily with automatic expiration.

Let me know if you'd like me to guide you through configuring the service code or if you need any other help.

## üîß **Main Technologies and Tools I Used for OTP Sending and Verification:**

Redis download link https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases

| **Tool / Library**                         | **Purpose**                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spring Boot**                           | Main framework for building the backend service.              |
| **JavaMailSender (Spring Boot Starter Mail)** | To send OTP emails to users.                                  |
| **Redis**                                 | To store OTPs temporarily with expiration (fast in-memory key-value store). |
| **RedisTemplate**                         | Spring's way to interact with Redis for saving and fetching OTPs. |
| **Random (java.util.Random)**             | To generate secure random OTP numbers.                         |
| **TimeUnit**                              | To set expiry time when storing OTPs in Redis (e.g., 5 minutes). |

### **What I did in each step:**

| **Step**            | **What I Used**                                                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generate OTP**     | Used `Random` class to create a 4-digit random number.                |
| **Send OTP**         | Used `JavaMailSender` to send the OTP via email.                       |
| **Store OTP**        | Used `RedisTemplate` to save (email, OTP) pairs with 5-minute expiry.  |
| **Verify OTP**       | Retrieved OTP from Redis using `RedisTemplate` and matched it with user input. |
| **Expiry/Auto Delete** | Redis automatically deletes expired OTPs ‚Äî no manual cleanup needed. |

### **Simple Explanation**
"I used Spring Boot along with Redis to create a fast, scalable OTP system. `JavaMailSender` handles sending OTPs to emails, and Redis stores OTPs temporarily with automatic expiration to ensure security and avoid database overhead."

## üîÑ **Why Use Redis Instead of Just a Map?**

**Map** is like putting OTPs inside your app‚Äôs memory ‚Äî like writing it on a whiteboard inside your room.  
**Redis** is like putting OTPs in a special locker outside your room that everyone can use safely.

### üö´ **Problems with Using Only a Map**:
- **No auto delete**:  
  In **Map**, OTPs stay forever unless you manually remove them. You have to write extra code to delete OTPs after 5 minutes.

- **If the app restarts, OTPs are gone**:  
  **Map** is inside your app. If your app crashes or restarts, all OTPs disappear ‚Äî users will be angry because their OTPs stop working.

- **Not safe if many users**:  
  **Map** can get full and crash if too many OTPs are stored. **Memory problem!**

- **Not good for big systems**:  
  If you have many servers (in cloud or load balancer), each server will have its own Map ‚Äî they won‚Äôt share OTPs. One server won‚Äôt know OTP from another server!

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Why Redis is Better**:
- **Auto-delete**:  
  Redis automatically removes OTP after 5 minutes. No extra code needed.

- **Safe even if app restarts**:  
  OTP stays in Redis even if your app crashes and comes back.

- **One common place**:  
  If you have many servers, all servers can talk to Redis and use the same OTPs.

- **Super fast**:  
  Redis is designed for quick, temporary storage. Faster than database, faster than saving in app memory.

- **Less coding, more safety**:  
  You don't need to worry about deleting old OTPs manually. Redis handles it.

---

### üß† **Simple Final Answer**:
"We used Redis because it automatically deletes OTPs after some time by using expires, keeps data safe even if the server crashes, works if we have many servers, and is much faster and safer than using a simple Map inside the app."
